# Blue spaces
The file here includes a list of all blue spaces (defined here as rivers, lakes, canals, coastline). As these are a series of lines and polygons, I have sample points along them every 100m. So accessibility metrics will be distance to the nearest point. One can create this file by running `process_input_bluesp.R` in the folder `ukroutes`.
