# Groundswell indicators
A repo for all the geographical indicators created as part of the GroundsWell project. This includes:
* Accessibility - development of a series of measures which estimate the accessibility of a household to its nearest feature (e.g., nearest green space).
* Flood risk - a lookup table for whether a household is located in an area at risk of flooding from surface water, fluvial or coastal processes.
* Satellites - household-level indicators of green and blue space exposure derived from satellite imagery.
